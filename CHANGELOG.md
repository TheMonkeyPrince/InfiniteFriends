## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-20

### BREAKING!

-   Downgraded from BepInHecks/BepInEx 6, to BepInEx 5 and [ModWeaver](https://github.com/modweaver/modweaver).
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When updating from 0.2.1, either BepInEx 5 or ModWeaver will need to be installed.
    > To uninstall BepInHecks: remove the `BepInEx` folder found in your SpiderHeck install directory,
    > and install either BepInEx 5 or ModWeaver, overwriting any files needed. Note that this will also remove any old mods
    > or configuration files. See [README.md](https://github.com/Senyksia/InfiniteFriends/blob/main/README.md) for updated or more detailed information.

> [!NOTE]
> The [1.1.0 release](https://github.com/modweaver/modweaver/releases/tag/1.1.0) of **ModWeaver** is non-functional at time of writing; instead the [latest build](https://github.com/modweaver/modweaver/actions/runs/10702095842/artifacts/1891040653) should be installed,
> until a new ModWeaver release is officially published.

>
> ### Fixed
