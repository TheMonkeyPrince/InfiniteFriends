## Installation

1. **Locate your SpiderHeck install directory**

   | `Steam library` -> `Right click SpiderHeck` -> `Manage` -> `Browse local files`. |
      |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
   | ![A visual guide to locating the SpiderHeck directory](../assets/locating_directory.png?raw=true) |

   On Windows, it will typically be located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpiderHeck`.

> [!TIP]
> ModWeaver is the standard mod-loader for SpiderHeck, and is what you will probably need when using other mods.
> <br />If you're unsure which to install, go with ModWeaver. BepInEx 5 support is provided as an alternative or fallback.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [1.1.0 release](https://github.com/modweaver/modweaver/releases/tag/1.1.0) of **ModWeaver** is non-functional at time of writing;
> Until a new release is published, BepInEx should be installed instead.

## Contributing

### Microsoft Store Compatibility

To support both Steam and Microsoft Store versions, `[BepInProcess("SpiderHeckApp.exe")]` was removed from `InfiniteFriends.cs`. The Microsoft Store version uses the executable name `SPIDERHECK`, so this change allows the mod to load for both versions.

1. **Clone the latest source code**

   `git clone https://github.com/Senyksia/InfiniteFriends.git`

2. **Link to your SpiderHeck directory**

   Create a file called `InfiniteFriends.csproj.user` next to `InfiniteFriends.csproj`.
   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <Project>
     <PropertyGroup>
       <GameDir>path\to\SpiderHeck</GameDir>                                                    <!-- User-defined absolute path to SpiderHeck -->
       <ReferencePath>$(ReferencePath);$(GameDir)\SpiderHeckApp_Data\Managed</ReferencePath> <!-- Path to the SH game assemblies -->
       <AssemblySearchPaths>$(AssemblySearchPaths);$(ReferencePath)</AssemblySearchPaths>       <!-- Add that path to the assembly search list -->
     </PropertyGroup>
   </Project>
   ```
   Replace `path\to\SpiderHeck` with the absolute path to your SpiderHeck directory. E.g.
   ```xml
   <GameDir>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpiderHeck</GameDir>
   ```

3. **Set up your SpiderHeck directory**

   Because we are building for multiple mod-loaders, your game directory will need to contain both of them (assuming you are building for both). This can mostly be done without conflict by simply installing both. Notably, however, each loader's `doorstop_config.ini` will need to be preserved. The Doorstop (`winhttp.dll`) version may also conflict; keeping the latest one should be sufficient.

   To launch with a particular loader, rename the dormant loader's `doorstop_config.ini` to something else, e.g. `doorstop_config.modweaver.ini`. This is a finicky solution, but as far as I can tell the `--doorstop-target-assembly` CLI parameter was broken in Doorstop 4, or I just can't get it to work.

5. **Compile**

   ModWeaver and BepInEx each have a build configuration.
   <br />Using Visual Studio or Rider, building will close the game and copy the compiled .dll directly into your mod folder.
